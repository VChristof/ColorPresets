After installation the Color Manager in the VAB will be updated with the "Extra Colors" option. Use the "+" sign to save presets.
The presets can be scrolled by dragging them.
The presets are stored independently of save files under:
"%user%\AppData\LocalLow\Intercept Games\Kerbal Space Program 2\ColorPresets.json"
Deleting a preset in one save will delete it everywhere
